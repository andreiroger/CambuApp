At this stage, the next improvements should shift from “add features” to stability, realism, and retention. Those are what turn an app from a demo into something people actually use.

Here is what I would do next, ordered by impact.

What You Should Do Next (After Alpha 0.2)
1. Switch Session Storage (Critical)

Right now sessions use MemoryStore, which is fine for development but not safe for real users.

Implement:

PostgreSQL session store or Redis

Automatic session cleanup

Session persistence after server restart

This is one of the most important production steps.

2. Real-Time Chat (Major UX Upgrade)

Currently:

Chat uses polling every few seconds.

Upgrade to:

WebSockets (you already have ws installed)

Benefits:

Instant messages

Typing indicators

Seen status

Users immediately notice this improvement.

3. Notifications System

You need a way to bring users back.

Add:

Notification table

Notifications for:

Party accepted

Message received

Party starting soon

Frontend:

Bell icon

Badge count

Later:

Push notifications (Expo or Firebase)

4. Improve Party Discovery Algorithm

Right now filtering is good, but discovery can be smarter.

Add ranking factors:

Distance

Host rating

Vibe match with personality

Popularity

Sort score example:
score = distanceWeight + vibeMatch + hostTrust + activity

This dramatically improves the browse experience.

5. Friend / Social Graph System

Retention increases massively when people see familiar faces.

Add:

Friends or followers

“Friends attending” indicator

Invite friends to party

This is one of the biggest growth features for social apps.

6. Attendance Confidence Signals

Guests hesitate without trust signals.

Add:

“People already going” avatars

Host response rate

Party activity level

These reduce hesitation.

7. Better Onboarding Optimization

Your onboarding is already good. Now optimize conversion.

Add:

Progress indicator

Skip options

Auto-detect vibe suggestions

Goal:
Under 60 seconds to usable state.

8. Moderation Tools (Important Before Growth)

Add:

Report user

Report party

Report message

Admin panel already exists, so just add reporting flows.

9. Prevent Abandoned Parties

Add:

Auto-cancel if host inactive

Reminder to hosts 24h before event

Auto-archive old parties

Keeps the app clean.

10. Improve Image Handling

Currently:

Uploads work

Add:

Image compression

Thumbnail generation

Lazy loading galleries

This improves performance significantly on mobile.

11. Security Improvements

You already implemented strong password handling and rate limiting.

Next steps:

CSRF protection

Helmet middleware

Upload scanning (file type validation beyond MIME)

Limit login attempts per account as well as per IP

These are standard before real users.

12. Performance Improvements

Add:

Response caching for:

Map queries

Party browse

And:

Query limits on large tables

13. Business Model Foundations

Even if monetization is later, structure early.

Add:

isPromoted flag on parties

featured party section

business accounts

No payment system yet, just the structure.

14. UX Polish That Makes a Big Difference

Small things that feel huge to users:

Add:

Skeleton loaders

Pull-to-refresh

Haptic feedback triggers

Smooth page transitions

These make the app feel professional.

15. Metrics and Analytics (Very Important)

Add:

Number of parties created

Join conversion rate

Daily active users

Retention

Without metrics, you’re flying blind.

16. Crash and Error Monitoring

Add:

Sentry or logging dashboard

So you can see:

Real user errors

Failed API calls

Verification failures

What Stage You Are At

Right now your app is at:

Prototype → Early Alpha → Functional Alpha

To reach Beta readiness, you need:

Real-time systems

Notifications

Moderation

Stability

Analytics

Not more core features.

If You Want the Smartest Next Move

The single most impactful feature to add next is:

“People going” visualization and friend indicators

It dramatically increases join rates because parties feel real instead of empty.
