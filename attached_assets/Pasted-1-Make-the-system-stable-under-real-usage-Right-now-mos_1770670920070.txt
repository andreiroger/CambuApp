1. Make the system stable under real usage

Right now most MVP apps work fine with 5 users and break with 50.

To reach alpha 0.1, focus on:

Rate limiting

Prevent:
• spam login attempts
• spam party requests
• brute force

Even a simple middleware limit per IP helps a lot.

Input constraints

Protect the database from:
• extremely long descriptions
• emoji floods
• broken coordinates

Set:
• max lengths on text fields
• validation on numbers and dates

Pagination

Browsing parties should not load everything at once.

Add:
• limit
• offset or cursor

This becomes necessary much sooner than people expect.

2. Make data consistent over time

Early apps often break not because of features but because of stale data.

For example:

Automatic cleanup

Add background jobs for:
• parties that already passed
• expired requests
• inactive sessions

Even a daily cron job is enough.

Status transitions

Right now parties probably only exist as “a party”.

Alpha apps usually need:
• upcoming
• ongoing
• finished
• cancelled

This unlocks:
• reviews automatically
• better filtering
• fewer logic hacks later

3. Make the experience understandable for first-time users

At alpha stage, confusion kills apps more than bugs.

Add:

Empty states

What happens when:
• no parties exist in a city
• user has no requests
• profile incomplete

Instead of blank pages:
Show:
• explanation
• suggested action

This dramatically improves usability.

First-run guidance

Very lightweight:
• short hints
• 1 or 2 tooltips

Not a tutorial, just orientation.

4. Logging and observability

This is something many people forget until production.

At alpha:
You need to know when things break.

Add:
• request logging
• error logging
• failed login tracking

Even simple console + file logs help.

5. Prepare the system for multiple environments

Right now many apps are implicitly “dev mode”.

Alpha requires:

Environment separation:
• development
• testing
• production

Use:
• .env files
• different database URLs

This prevents catastrophic mistakes.

6. Protect against the most common real-world problems

Not security research level, just basics:

Add:
• basic profanity filtering (optional but useful for public apps)
• duplicate request prevention
• preventing users from requesting their own party

Small rules like this improve realism.

7. Make hosting feel real

This is subtle but important.

Hosts should feel:
“I am managing an event”

Good alpha features:
• attendee count progress bar
• simple dashboard view
• quick accept/decline

You already have the backend for this, it’s mostly UX polish.

8. Prepare for real testers

Before alpha testing, add:

Admin abilities (hidden route)

Minimal:
• delete party
• ban user
• reset review

Without this, testing becomes painful.

9. Performance quick wins

You don’t need optimization yet, but do:

• Add indexes on:

city

hostId

partyId

These fields are queried often and indexing helps immediately.

10. Define what alpha means for your app

For a party platform, alpha 0.1 usually means:

• Users can sign up
• Users can create parties
• Users can request and attend
• Reviews work
• Nothing crashes under normal usage

Not:
• perfect UI
• perfect scaling
• full messaging systems

Alpha is about complete flow, not polish.

A useful way to think about alpha 0.1

Ask one question:

If 20 strangers used this for a week, would:

They understand what to do?

The system stay stable?

The data remain consistent?

If yes, you are ready for alpha.
