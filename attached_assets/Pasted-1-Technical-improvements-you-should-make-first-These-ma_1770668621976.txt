1. Technical improvements you should make first

These matter before adding flashy features.

Password security (highest priority)

Right now:

passwords are stored in plain text

login compares raw values

That is visible in your auth routes and seed data. 

CambuApp alfa.0.0

You should:

hash passwords with bcrypt

compare hashes on login

hash seed data too

This is the first thing to fix before any real deployment.

Fix request authorization logic

In this route:

PATCH /api/requests/:id/status

You update the request before verifying the host owns the party. 

CambuApp alfa.0.0

Correct order should be:

Load request

Load party

Verify host

Then update status

Then add attendee

Otherwise someone could potentially manipulate requests.

Database performance improvement

Your getAttendeeParties function loops and queries each party one by one. 

CambuApp alfa.0.0

This is fine for 20 users but will slow down quickly.

Better:
Use a JOIN query to fetch all parties in one request.

Validation gaps

You validate:

user creation

party creation

But:

PATCH routes accept raw req.body

You should:

create update schemas

validate before update

Otherwise bad data will eventually break things.

Session store

You’re using MemoryStore. 

CambuApp alfa.0.0

Good for development, but later:

Redis sessions

secure cookies in production

This can wait until beta.

2. Product improvements to better fit the purpose of the app

Your app already supports:

parties

requests

attendees

reviews

profiles

So the foundation is right.

Now you need features that make it feel like a party network, not just an event list.

A. Party lifecycle

Right now parties are just records.

Add:

status: upcoming / ongoing / finished

auto-close after date

review prompt after party

This is a big usability improvement.

B. Discovery improvements

Your browse is basic filtering by city.

Add:

filters:

theme

price

date

crowd size

sort:

nearest

most popular

newest

This is essential for mobile users who scroll fast.

C. Messaging (biggest missing feature)

Party apps need communication.

Minimal version:

host announcements

chat in requests

message accepted guests

Even simple messaging dramatically improves usefulness.

D. Trust and safety layer

You already have:

ID verified flag

reviews

Add:

profile completeness score

number of parties attended

repeat guest indicator

These increase confidence.

E. Notifications

You already store:

notificationsEnabled 

CambuApp alfa.0.0

But no notification system yet.

Add:

request accepted

party starting soon

host message

This is one of the biggest retention drivers.

3. How to change the “instructions” and logic to fit the purpose better

This is the most important part conceptually.

Right now the app logic is:

“List parties → request → attend”

But the real purpose should be:

“Curate good social experiences safely.”

So the UX and instructions should guide behavior.

A. Onboarding should guide the experience

Currently onboarding only checks city and country in the guard. 

CambuApp alfa.0.0

Better onboarding:

Ask:

preferred music or vibe

small gatherings or big parties

host or guest preference

Then:

tailor browsing

recommend parties

B. Instructions for hosts

When creating a party, guide the host.

Instead of only:

title

description

max guests

Guide them with prompts:

What vibe do you want?

Who should come?

What should guests bring?

House rules?

This improves party quality dramatically.

C. Instructions for guests

When requesting:

Encourage:

short intro

why they want to come

what they bring

You already have:
message
pledgedItems 

CambuApp alfa.0.0

That’s good design. You just need to emphasize it in UI.

D. Behavioral guidance

Small UX hints improve community behavior:

Show tips like:

Respect host space

Arrive on time

Bring what you promised

These small touches matter a lot in social apps.

E. Positioning logic

Your app should feel like:

Not:
“Public event marketplace”

But:
“Curated social network”

So:

show mutual friends

show trust signals first

emphasize host personality and vibe

4. Improvements that would move this from Alfa to Beta

If you only did five things:

Password hashing

Messaging

Discovery filters

Notifications

Better onboarding

That alone would make it feel like a real product.

5. How to change the instructions you give Google AI Studio

If you’re using AI to improve the app, give it this direction:

Prompt to give AI Studio
